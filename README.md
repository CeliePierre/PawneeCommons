## Part 2 - Data Gathering, Cleaning, and SQL Commands
In part two, the team worked on gathering and cleaning scraped information, writing SQL commands, and creating a video explaining these commands. Célie, Reihaneh, and Sarah once again distributed the tasks among themselves. Célie wrote SQL commands, converted them into procedures, and created the import_data_to_sql.py script. Reihaneh organized CSV files based on the ER diagram, assisted with SQL commands, and contributed to testing. Sarah handled Python web scraping, organized scraped information, and created the explanation video for this section.
