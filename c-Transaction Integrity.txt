Title: Transaction Integrity Check 
The code performs an update operation on the `PawneeCommons.works` table and checks if the update violates certain constraints. If the constraints are violated, the transaction is rolled back; otherwise, it is committed.
Code Explanation:
1. Start the Transaction:
   - The code begins by initiating a transaction. A transaction is a series of one or more SQL statements executed as a single unit.
2. Update Operation:
   - An update operation is performed on the `PawneeCommons.works` table. The code attempts to set the job title to 'Producer' for a specific record identified by `pID` and `eID`.
3. Allowed Job Titles:
   - A set of allowed job titles (Cast, written_by, directed_by) is specified using the `@allowed_job_titles` variable.
4. Integrity Constraint Check:
   - The code checks if the updated job title ('Producer') is in the allowed list using the `FIND_IN_SET` function. The result is stored in the `@job_check` variable.
5. Condition Evaluation:
   - A variable, `@rollback_required`, is set to 0 initially. The code then checks if the job title violates the allowed titles and updates the variable accordingly.
6. Rollback or Commit:
   - Depending on the condition, the code determines whether to rollback or commit the transaction. If `@rollback_required` is 1, meaning the constraint is violated, the transaction is rolled back; otherwise, it is committed.
7. Result Output:
   - The final result is displayed as 'Transaction Rolled Back' or 'Transaction Committed' based on the outcome of the condition.
Conclusion:
This code checks that only specified job titles are allowed in the database, and any update with an invalid title will result in a rollback of the transaction. This is critical for data integrity and consistency of the database.
